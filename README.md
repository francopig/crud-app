Welcome to your new JavaScript application!

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can run the following commands in your project's root directory:

``` 
npm install
npm create vite@latest
npm run server
npm run dev
```

Happy coding! ðŸ˜‹
